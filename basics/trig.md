# Motion with Sine and Cosine

There are two math functions from trig that we can use to create motion, `sin()` and `cos()`.

Both these functions will return a number between -1 and 1. We can use this value is so many different ways to create motion.

# Sine and Cosine
In [this video](https://youtu.be/GtESJsZdgTE) we can see how to use `sin()` and `cos()` to move a shape back and forth. 
 
Here is the completed code, try changing the values to see how the motion changes.

# Circular Motion
In [this video](https://youtu.be/I4QrQl4OwZM) we see how using `cos()` to update the x value and `sin()` to update the y value can create circular motion.

Here is another code example. See how changing the values can change the motion.
